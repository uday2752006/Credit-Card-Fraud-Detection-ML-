Credit Card Fraud Detection â€“ Project Report
1. Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial sector, as unauthorized or illegitimate transactions result in substantial monetary losses. Identifying these transactions in real-time has become critical.

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions using both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. We aim to build a deployable system that not only provides accurate predictions but also features an intuitive interface for real-time and batch inference.

2. Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle.

Key Details:
Total transactions: 284,807

Fraudulent transactions: 492 (~0.172%)

Features: V1 to V28 (PCA-transformed), Time, and Amount

Label: Class (1 = Fraud, 0 = Normal)

The data is highly imbalanced, which poses a challenge for most classification models. Special care was taken in preprocessing and model evaluation to handle this.

3. Techniques Used
We used a hybrid approach combining anomaly detection and supervised classification:

3.1 Anomaly Detection
Isolation Forest: Works by isolating anomalies instead of profiling normal data.

Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Detects anomalies by comparing the local density of a point with its neighbors.

3.2 Supervised Classification
XGBoost Classifier: A scalable and highly accurate boosting model.

The model was trained on balanced data using under-sampling techniques and evaluated using proper classification metrics.

3.3 Evaluation Metrics
To assess performance:

Confusion Matrix: For true/false positives/negatives.

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Especially important due to imbalance.

ROC Curve & AUC: For visualizing performance across thresholds.

4. Streamlit Dashboard
A user-friendly, interactive dashboard was created using Streamlit. It allows:

4.1 Single Transaction Prediction
Sidebar inputs for Time, Amount, V1 to V28 features.

Prediction displayed as Fraud or Normal, along with confidence scores.

4.2 Batch CSV Upload
Upload a file containing multiple transactions.

Results displayed with prediction labels.

If true labels are provided, shows a confusion matrix and ROC curve.

4.3 Visualizations
Bar graph of prediction probabilities.

Confusion Matrix (interactive heatmap using Plotly).

ROC Curve with AUC score.

This makes the tool accessible to analysts and operations teams without deep technical knowledge.

Streamlit dashboard adds usability and practical value.

Model performs well despite class imbalance, achieving high precision for the minority class.

Future Work
Automate model retraining with incoming data.

Deploy as a REST API or integrate with transaction systems.

Expand dataset with real-world features if possible.
